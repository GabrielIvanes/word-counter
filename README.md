This is a classic word counter built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

To use it, simply copy and paste your text or write it directly into the input field. Then, click the "Comptez !" button.

The first box displays the number of words in the text. In my script, I have chosen to delete all special characters such as dashes, apostrophes, exclamation marks, ... when counting the words. As a result, "I'll" is counted as two words and "grown-up" is also counted as two words.

The second box displays the number of characters, with spaces not included in the count.

Below the "Liste des mots" heading, you will see a list of all the words used in your text, along with the number of times each word appears under the "Nombres d'apparitions" heading.
